Box Office is a very simple app written to keep track of ticket sales for my [band's](http://kaepora.com/) gigs.

It is written in Ruby on Rails with a monolithic architecture due to the simplicity of the functionality, with enough HTML and CSS to successfully display some relevant information with basic styling. It is deployed privately. 

Database Schema:

The purpose of the app is to display total ticket sales for a given gig, including the number of tickets sold and the total revenue, broken down by each member. It also serves as a kind of "will call" with all of the names of the ticket-buyers.
